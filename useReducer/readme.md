useReducer is a state management hook in React, primarily used to handle more complex state logic. It is often preferred for separating and managing the logic used to update a component's state. While both useReducer and useState serve similar purposes, there are advantages to using useReducer in certain situations.

Here are the key features of useReducer and the points where it differs from useState:

Advanced State Management: useReducer is typically used to handle more complex state logic. If state changes are connected to specific logic or if multiple state changes occur together, useReducer might be a better option.

Cleaner and Modular Code: useReducer allows you to separate logic related to state changes through reducer functions. This can make your code cleaner and more modular, especially in large and complex components.

Performance Benefits: In large applications or when state logic is complex, useReducer can provide performance benefits. This includes more efficient management of state changes and prevention of unnecessary render processes.

Adding Middleware Functions: With useReducer, you can add middleware functions similar to Redux. This allows you to control and customize state changes in a broader context.
