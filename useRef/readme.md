Storing References:
The reference object created with useRef remains the same throughout the component's lifecycle. This implies that the reference is not reset during each rendering process. This is beneficial when you want to update or modify the reference.

Storing Values:
useRef can also be utilized to store a value. Changing the value does not trigger a re-render of the component, making it different from using useState to update values.

Access to DOM Elements:
useRef is commonly used to access DOM elements. The reference, when used in conjunction with the ref attribute, provides access to the relevant DOM element.
